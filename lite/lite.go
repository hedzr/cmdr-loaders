// Package lite provides a lightweight implementation of loaders,
// which can load into a key-value store from these external
// sources: toml file, json file, and OS environment.
//
// It is designed to be used with the cmdr package for command-line applications.
//
// The difference between this package and the cmdr-loaders (/ local)
// package is that this package has less dependencies and is more lightweight,
// while the cmdr-loaders package is more feature-rich and has more dependencies.
